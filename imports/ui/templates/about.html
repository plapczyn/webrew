                <h2>About weBrew</h2>
                <p>The concept came about in traditional family fashion. We were sitting around drinking some tasty coffee brews and were talking about the attributes and what we liked about it. 
                    "There really needs to be a coffee rating app" someone mentioned. Soon after the dream became a reality, and weBrew was born.
